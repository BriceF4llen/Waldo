# Waldo

Read comments in Waldo.ino for pin structure. More will be added later.

I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR ANY OF THE LIBRARIES! 

All libraries were actually taken from GitHub and contain their original documentation. A .zip of my libraries was included for convenience. If they are not included via the appropriate file structure on your machine, the source code for Waldo won't work.
